Wrappers for functions in the gRain package to emulate some RHugin 
  functionality, allowing the building of Bayesian networks incrementally, through
  adding nodes, edges and conditional probability tables, the setting of evidence, 
  both 'hard' (boolean) or 'soft' (likelihoods), and querying marginal probabilities
  and normalizing constants. I am grateful to Søren Højsgaard for enhancements
  to his gRain package that improve the performance of this package.
  
  Before installing this package, you have to install the dependencies of gRain 
  (see https://people.math.aau.dk/~sorenh/software/gR/) and gRain itself, in version 1.3.12 or later (on CRAN)
